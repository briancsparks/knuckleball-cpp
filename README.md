# Knuckleball for C++

This is my uber-broad experimental / exploration project for C/C++.

I'm always trying an experiment or other in the several languages I use. So,
just as an organizational tool, I put them all here. Then, I can steal code
from this project in any 'real' projects I am working on.

## Including...

- Use [Hunter](https://hunter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as C++ package manager.
  See [github.com/cpp-pm](https://github.com/cpp-pm/hunter).
  - _Very_ impressive.
- Using Boost
- Using RapidJSON


## But Why?

`Knuckle` is just a cool sounding word.
